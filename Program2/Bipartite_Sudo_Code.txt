Algorithim Design
Aidan McCoy

A (vertex) coloring of a graph is an assignment of color to each of the vertices such that no two adjacent
vertices share the same color. See section 3.1 of your text for an example of a coloring of a map.
You will implement an algorithm to determine if a graph is two-colorable, that is if there is a coloring of the
graph that uses no more than two colors. You will also determine how many connected components there
are

BipartiteCheck(A)

Input: A list of pairs of numbers representing edges between verticies in an undirected graph.
Output: -1 if the graph is not bipartite or the number of connected components if the graph is bipartite.
