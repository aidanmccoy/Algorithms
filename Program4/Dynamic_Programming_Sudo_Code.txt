Input: A text file with 3 line of numbers
    The first line has number of lockers, number of keys, and number of tennis balls
    The second line has the numbers of the lockers of which keys you are given
    The third line has the numbers of the lockers that contain tennis balls

Output: The minimum number of lockers that can be opened to get all of the tennis balls

Array Lockers [numOfLockers]
Array Balls [numOfBalls]
Array Keys [numOfKeys]

Array Distances [numOfLockers][numOfKeys]

totalDistance = 0

For Each Locker with ball in Input  //Fills in table with distance to each ball from each key
    For each key
        Calculate distance to ball lockers
        Distances[ballLocker][keyNumber] = distanceCalculated

For each ball lockers
    Find minimum distance to ball
    If a previous path covers the ball
        break
    Else
        totalDistance = totalDistance + minDistance
        if other balls are covered in minPath
            totalDistance = totalDistance - distance to covered balls

return totalDistance;
